# Gemini's Memory

This section contains facts that Gemini has been asked to remember across sessions.

- The user wants me to update the GEMINI.md file after each interaction to keep the knowledge base up-to-date.

# CloudFront Signed URLs

When generating signed URLs for CloudFront, the following should be considered:

- The `expireTime` parameter for `aws-cloudfront-sign`'s `getSignedUrl` function should be in milliseconds.
- The `privateKeyString` parameter should be used to pass the private key string, not `privateKey`.

# Update Event

The `PUT /events/:eventId` route is used to update an event.
- The request body can contain a `data` field with the event data in JSON format, an `image` file, or both. At least one of `data` or `image` must be present.
- The `image` field can be used to upload a new image for the event.
- The `updateEvent` service function handles the update logic.
- It can update any of the fields in the `events` table.
- When a new image is uploaded, the old image is deleted from S3.
- The service returns `{ success: true, eventId: string, message: string }`.

# Delete Event

The `DELETE /events/:eventId` route is used to delete an event.
- The `deleteEvent` service function handles the delete logic.
- It deletes the event from the `events` table.
- It also deletes the associated image from S3 if it exists.
- The service returns `{ success: true, message: string }`.

# Event Details Schema (for getEventById)

When returning details for a single event, the following schema should be used.

- `id`: string (UUID)
- `title`: string
- `description`: string
- `eventType`: string (formerly `event_type`)
- `date`: string (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `startTime`: string (H:MM AM/PM format, formerly `end_time` in HH:MM:SS)
- `endTime`: string (H:MM AM/PM format, formerly `end_time` in HH:MM:SS)
- `venue`: string
- `eligibility`: string
- `fee`: string
- `registrationLink`: string (formerly `registration_link`)
- `organizers`: array of objects with `orgName` and `parentOrgName`
- `contacts`: array of objects with `name`, `role`, and `phone`
- `imageUrl`: string (signed CloudFront URL, formerly `image_url`)
- `publisher`: object with `name` (from `fullname`) and `department`

The following fields from the database should be excluded from the response:
- `publisher_id`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

# Get All Events Schema (for getEvents)

When returning a list of all events, the following schema should be used for each event in the list.

- `id`: string (UUID)
- `title`: string
- `description`: string
- `date`: string (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `eventDepartment`: string (from the publisher's department)
- `eventType`: string
- `imageUrl`: string (signed CloudFront URL)

Events should be sorted in chronological order based on `date`, `start_time`, and `created_at` (like a social media feed).

# Get Publisher Profile

The `GET /profile` route in `src/routes/publisher.ts` is used to fetch the publisher's profile.
- It calls the `getProfile` service function in `src/services/publisher.service.ts`.
- The `getProfile` function has been implemented to fetch publisher details, past events, and upcoming events, using `userId` instead of `username`.
- The intended return schema for the profile data includes:
    - `user`: object with `username`, `role` (always "Publisher"), and `department`.
    - `pastEvents`: array of event objects, each with `imageUrl`, `title`, `date` (format "10 Jan, 2025"), and `eventType`.
    - `upcomingEvents`: array of event objects, with the same structure as `pastEvents`.
